## Description
A webpage that prompts the user to enter a food dish and their current location, and displays a list of recipies and local restaurants that match their search. The user may then decide if they would like to "Dine in" with a recipe, or "Dash out" at one of the restaurants offering their desired dish. The webpage will locally store the user’s recent searches and selections.

## User-Story
```
AS A user
I WANT to see recipes or local options with prices for the entree
SO THAT I'll know if it makes sense to cook at home or go out to eat, based on the price of the menu item or the complexity of the recipe to prepare the dish
```

## Functionality
```
GIVEN a choice to either make a meal at home or order out
WHEN I input a food dish and location in the app
THEN I am presented with a list of recipes and local restaurants that serve the dish
```

## Dine-Or-Dash-Story
Thanks for checking out Dine Or Dash. We created Dine Or Dash as a student portfolio project to address the dilemma of deciding whether to cook a meal at home or go out to eat. We know this can be frustrating and making a decision can be time consuming.

With the "Dine In" option, the webpage shows a list of the top 10 recipes based on your search criteria. When a recipe is clicked, the webpage shows all of the ingredients needed, as well as time needed to cook the dish and the directions on how to make it.

With the "Dash Out" option, the webpage will show you the top 10 local restaurants offering the main dish of your choice, based on the location criteria that you type in. Additionally, the browser will display the descriptions and prices, without you having to venture onto each restaurant's site.

This webpage also stores your past 10 searches and past 10 selected recipes, so you can revisit your favorite recipes or a restaurant to check out later on.
