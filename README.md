## The Dine Or Dash Story
Thanks for checking out Dine Or Dash. We created Dine Or Dash as a student protfolio project to solve a need with figureing out if it makes more sense to cook at home or to go out to eat. We know that this can be frustrating and often times you could spend an hour or more trying to figure this out.

With the Dash in option you can simply enter your location and a main dish of your choice and get local top menu items along with the descriptions and the prices without having to venture onto each resturants site.

With the Dine option we show a recepie list based on 10 top recipe results based on your search creteria. Once the receipes are expanded we show all of the ingreidents needed as well as time needed to cook the dish and the directions on how to make it.

This program also stores your past 5 searchs in case you found a favorite recepie or a resturant that you really enjoyed you can come back to it later.
