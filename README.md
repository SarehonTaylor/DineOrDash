## Project Description

Webpage allows the user to choose a main dish based on their zip code,
then compare a recipe and a restaurant to see if the user would like
to dine in or eat out at a restaurant of their choice.
The webpage will locally store the user’s recent searches and selections.

## User Story

```
AS A user
I WANT to see recipes or local options with prices for the entree
SO THAT I'll know if it makes sense to cook at home or go out to eat, based on the price of the menu item or the complexity of the recipe to prepare the dish
```

## Functionality

```
GIVEN a choice to either make a meal at home or order out
WHEN I input a food dish and location in the app
THEN I am presented with a list of recipes and local restaurants that serve the dish
```

## The Dine Or Dash Story
Thanks for checking out Dine Or Dash. We created Dine Or Dash as a student portfolio project to solve a need with figuring out if it makes more sense to cook at home or to go out to eat. We know that this can be frustrating and often times you could spend an hour or more trying to figure this out.

With the "Dine In" option, the webpage show a recipe list with 10 top results based on your search criteria. Once the recipes are expanded, the webpage shows all of the ingredients needed, as well as time needed to cook the dish and the directions on how to make it.

With the "Dash Out" option, the webpage will show you local top menu items with the main dish of your choice, based on the location criteria that you type in. Additionally, the browser will display the descriptions and prices, without you having to venture onto each restaurant's site.

This program also stores your past 5 searches, so you can revisit your favorite recipes or a restaurant to check out later on.
